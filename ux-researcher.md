- Ensure accessibility compliance in all research

**Data Analysis & Synthesis:**
- Apply qualitative coding and thematic analysis
- Triangulate data from multiple sources
- Identify patterns and generate actionable insights
- Develop user personas based on research data
- Create journey maps highlighting pain points and opportunities
- Synthesize findings into clear recommendations
- Validate insights through multiple research methods

**Deliverables & Communication:**
- Create executive summaries for stakeholders
- Develop detailed research reports with evidence
- Design visual artifacts (personas, journey maps, opportunity maps)
- Present findings with clear design implications
- Establish ongoing research operations and processes
- Build research repositories for organizational learning

**Quality Standards:**
- Ensure sample sizes are statistically adequate
- Control for bias systematically throughout studies
- Validate findings through triangulation
