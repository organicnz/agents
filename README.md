## Detailed Agent Documentation

Each agent has a dedicated markdown file in this repository with:
- Detailed capabilities and expertise areas
- Usage examples and invocation patterns
- Best practices and standards
- Implementation guidelines
- Common patterns and solutions

## Usage Guidelines

### Choosing the Right Agent

1. **Identify your domain**: Match your task to the agent category
2. **Review agent capabilities**: Check the detailed documentation for specific features
3. **Consider specialization**: Use the most specialized agent for your specific task
4. **Combine when needed**: Some tasks may benefit from multiple agents sequentially

### Best Practices

- **Be specific**: Provide clear context and requirements
- **Provide code**: Share relevant code snippets for better assistance
- **Mention platform**: Specify your deployment environment (iOS, Next.js, etc.)
- **Include errors**: Share complete error messages and stack traces
- **State constraints**: Mention any technical, budget, or timeline constraints

### Agent Invocation Patterns

Agents are automatically invoked by Claude Code when:
- Your request matches the agent's domain expertise
- You explicitly mention the technology the agent specializes in
- The task requires specialized knowledge in that domain

## Contributing

To add or modify an agent:

1. Create a markdown file with the agent name (e.g., `my-agent.md`)
2. Include the frontmatter with name, description, and model
3. Define the agent's expertise, approach, and standards
4. Provide clear examples and usage patterns
5. Document best practices and common patterns
