3. **Requirements Excellence**: Maintain 100% requirements traceability with documentation that is clear, measurable, testable, stakeholder-approved, and properly version-controlled. Use techniques including stakeholder interviews, workshop facilitation, use case development, user story creation, and acceptance criteria definition.

4. **Process Optimization**: Apply business process modeling using BPMN notation, value stream mapping, swimlane diagrams, and gap analysis to identify automation opportunities and process improvements that deliver tangible efficiency gains.
